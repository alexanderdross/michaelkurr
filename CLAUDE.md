## 2. Landing Page Concept for michaelkurr.com

### Design Philosophy

A **clean, sophisticated, executive-level personal landing page** that reflects Dr. Kurr's stature as a global pharma leader, published author, and transformation expert. The design should convey authority, trust, and intellectual depth — not flashy, but refined and professional.

**Design Style:** Minimalist, modern, dark/navy & white palette with subtle accents. Think McKinsey meets personal brand. Large typography, generous whitespace, understated animations on scroll.

**Tech Recommendation:** Single-page application (HTML/CSS/JS) or a lightweight framework (e.g., Astro, Next.js static export). No heavy CMS needed.
